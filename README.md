Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
- Is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software application.
- Programming is centered around the code whereas Software engineering is extended over the intire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
- Is the structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software in the shortest possible production time.

PLANNING PHASE
Is the fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built and detrrming how the project team will go about building it.

ANALYSIS PHASE
Its answers the questions of who will use the system, what the system will do, and where and when it will be used. During this phase , the project team investigates any current system, identifies improvement, opportunities, and develops a concept for the new system.

DESIGN PHASE
Decides how the system will operate in terms of the hardware, software and network infrastructure that will be in place; the user interface, forms, and reports that will be used; and the specific programs, databases and files that will be needed.

IMPLEMENTAION PHASE
This is the phase during which the system is actually built, its usually gets the most attention because for most systems it is the longest and most expensive single part of the development process.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

- Agile is an iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration among cross-functional teams. it focuses on delivering small, incremental releases, adapting to changes throughtout the development process.

In contrast, Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed. Agile promotes adaptability and customer feedback, while Waterfall provides a structured plan that may struggle with accommodating changes late in the development cycle.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuos feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. Agile promotes ongoing collaboratio, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages.

Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal. if a project owner has a clear and specific vision of an app, for example, and is confident it will not change throughout the project development, Waterfall methodologies could be a good system to follow. Meanwhile, Agile leaves a lot of room to adapt and change course as the project develops. It's better suited for projects where the outcome may be dependent on more research or testing.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
- Is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design peocess.

REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING PROCESS
Requirements Elicitation : Gather requirements from stakeholders throught various techniques like interviews, surveys and focus group.

Requirements Analysis : Analyze and interpret the collected requirements to understand the needs and expectations of the stakehoolder.

Requirements Specification : Document the requirments in a clear, concise and unambigious manner using techniques like use cases, user story or requirements diagrams.

Requirements Verification : Check the requirements for completeness, consistency aand accuracy to ensure they are feasible and meet the stakeholders' needs.

Requirement Validat6ion : Confirm that the requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectactions of the stakeholders.

Requirements Management : Manage and maintain the requirements throughout the project lifecycle, including changes and updates.

Requirement Traceability : Ensure that each requirement is traceable to the design, implementation and testing phases.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
- Software design is the process to trasform user requirement into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.

MODULARITY
- Is a descriptive of software architecture and relate to what to what code is written. They are a relation over functionality and often correspond to a support subsystem.

IMPROVING MAINTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY OF SOFTWARE SYSTEM
This refers to how easily a system can be maintained, updated, repaired or modified without disrupting its functionality or performance. Maintainable software is essential for reducing costs, improving quality and enhancing user satisfaction. Scalability to a system's ability to handle increased load, usage or data without compromising performance, efficiency or effectiveness. Scalable software can adapt to growing demands, user bases or data volumes without requiring significant changes or rearchitecture.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
- It's the process of checking if a program or application works the way it's supposed to, the aim of testing in software engineering is to identify all the defects existing in a software product.

UNIT TESTING
Is done at the code level, where each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality. It is undertaken after a module has been coded and succefully reviewed, it is a testing of different units (or modules) of a system in isolation.

INTEGRATION TESTING
It enables software testers to test group units integrated into a system or subsystems; it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding error or integrations between modules. During integration testing, different modules of the system are integrated in a planned manner using an integration plan.

SYSTEM TESTING
Is the process in which a quality assurance(QA) team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application, it's performed on an integrated environment comprising the whole application, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements. You can use automation tools for System Testing.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING
It involves testing the system's Functional and Non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, usability, accessibility, compatibility and reliability. Depending on the system's complexity, it can be done manually or through automation tools.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
- Is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control system are software tools.

POPULAR VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS AND FEATURES
Local Version Control System : Is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is stored as a patch. Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version. In order to see what the file looked like at any given moment, it is necessary to add up all the relevant patches to the file in order until that given moment.

Centralized Version Control System : Has asingle server that contains all the the file versions. This enables multiple clients to simultaneously access file on the server, pull them to their local computer or push them onto the serverfrom their local computer, This way, everyone usually knows what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have control over who can do do what.

Distributed Version Control System : Clients don't jus check out the latest snapshoot of the files from their server, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project.





What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
- Is dedicated to the planning, scheduling, resource allocation, execution, tracking and delivery of software and web project.

THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
- Planning
- Scheduling
- Managing the delivery of software and web projects

THE PROJECT MANAGRMRNT CHALLENGES
- Misalignment between goals and business objectives.
- Communication
- Lack of accountability
- Resource allocation
- Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
- Is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.

TYPES OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE
CORRECTIVE - Corrective maintenance of a software product is neccesary to rectify the bugs observed while the system is in use.

ADAPTIVE - A software product might need maintenance when the customers need the product to run on new platforms, on new operating systems or when they need a product to interface with new hardware or software.

PERFECTIVE - A software product needs maintenance to support the new feature that users want it to support, to change different functionalities of the system according to customer demands, or to enhance the performance of the system.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
- Software engineers should strive to create inclusive and accessible software that does not discriminate against individuals based on race, gender, age, or disability.

ETHICAL ISSUES SOFTWARE ENGINEERS MIGHT FACE
- Safety
- Acceptable risk
- Compliance
- Data integrity


Software Engineers have to make sure they write clean, well documented code that is easy to maintain and understand. They should also prioritise security measures, implementing robust authentication and encryption mechanisms to protect user data.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
